## When you tap a button in a React Native application using the new architecture, a series of events occur across different threads. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how this process works in the new architecture (Fabric and Turbo Modules):

#### Step-by-Step Process of Button Tap Handling

###User Interaction:

When the user taps a button on the screen, the event is detected by the UI Thread. This thread is responsible for rendering the UI and handling user interactions.
Event Handling:

The button component (written in JavaScript) has an event handler (like onPress) associated with it. When the button is tapped, the UI thread generates an event that is sent to the JavaScript Thread.
JavaScript Thread Execution:

The JavaScript thread receives the event and processes it. It runs the event handler defined in the button component. This may involve executing JavaScript code that updates state, navigates to another screen, or calls a native module.
javascript
```js
const handleButtonPress = () => {
    // Logic to execute when the button is pressed
    console.log("Button was pressed!");
    NativeModules.MyTurboModule.performAction();
};
```

###Calling Native Modules:

If the event handler includes a call to a Turbo Module (a native module in the new architecture), the JavaScript thread communicates with the native code. This communication is optimized and can be done directly without the overhead of serialization.

```javascript
NativeModules.MyTurboModule.performAction(param1, param2);
Native Module Execution:
```

The Turbo Module runs on a separate Native Thread. It performs the requested operation (like fetching data or processing a task). This execution is independent of the JavaScript thread, allowing for concurrent operations.
```objc
// Objective-C implementation of the Turbo Module
- (void)performAction:(NSString *)param1 completion:(RCTResponseSenderBlock)completion {
    // Perform some operations in native code
    // ...

    // Call the completion handler to send the result back
    completion(@[[NSNull null], result]);
}
```
###Returning Results:

Once the native operation completes, the native module sends a response back to the JavaScript thread. This can be done via callbacks or Promises. The response is handled asynchronously, meaning the JavaScript thread continues executing without waiting for the response.
State Updates and UI Changes:

If the result from the native module requires a change in the UI, the JavaScript thread can update the application state (using hooks like useState or Redux) based on the response received.
The state update triggers a re-render of the affected components, and the changes are communicated to the UI Thread for rendering.
Rendering Updates:

The UI Thread processes any pending UI updates (including the results of the state changes) and performs the necessary rendering operations to reflect the new state in the UI.

###Summary
When a button is tapped:
The UI Thread detects the tap and generates an event.
The event is sent to the JavaScript Thread for processing.
The JavaScript event handler executes and may call a Turbo Module.
The Turbo Module runs on a Native Thread and performs the requested operation.
The native module sends results back to the JavaScript thread.
The JavaScript thread updates state and triggers UI updates.
The UI Thread re-renders the updated components.
This architecture ensures that user interactions are handled smoothly, with a clear separation of concerns and efficient use of resources, providing a responsive experience for users.
